The provided source code makes use of two notable libraries: cpr for making HTTP requests and nlohmann/json for handling JSON data. These choices are instrumental for the task at hand, allowing for efficient communication with the Solana RPC API and manipulation of its responses.

Key Components of the Source Code:

HTTP Requests: The cpr library is utilized to perform POST requests to the Solana RPC API endpoint. Despite the task mentioning GET methods, the actual communication with Solana RPC involves sending POST requests with specific method calls in the payload. This is a common practice for interacting with JSON-RPC APIs.
JSON Manipulation: The nlohmann/json library provides an intuitive way to construct JSON payloads for the requests and parse JSON responses. This library is chosen for its ease of use, efficiency, and wide acceptance in the C++ community.
Solana RPC Methods: Two RPC methods are demonstrated: getBalance and getAccountInfo. These methods are chosen to showcase different types of queries against the Solana blockchain, offering a glimpse into the broad capabilities of the Solana RPC API.
Libraries Used
CPR (C++ Requests): A modern C++ library for making HTTP requests. It wraps the popular C library libcurl and provides a much more convenient and modern C++ interface. CPR is chosen for its simplicity, robustness, and active maintenance.
nlohmann/json: A widely used JSON library for C++. It offers a straightforward approach to serializing and deserializing JSON data. The library is header-only, making it easy to integrate into projects. Its intuitive syntax and comprehensive features make it an excellent choice for JSON manipulation in C++.
